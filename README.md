# LandMines
The model identifies if a mine is present in a region based on these factors: output voltage of FLC sensor due to magnetic distortion, height of the sensor from the ground, and soil type (based on moisture and condition)
The model was correct 64% of the times where it predicted no mines, and 96% correct where it predicted mines. It predicted mines would be present 54 times and was correct 52 of those times, and predicted mines would not be present 14 times and was correct 9 of those times.
The model had a recall of 0.82 when predicting no mines present and 0.91 when predicting mines present, meaning that it predicted no mines present 82% of the time there were no mines present, and predicted mines present 91% of the time there were mines present.
